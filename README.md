NoReZodia was an experimental RPG Game project in Java to learn the language
and dates from around ~2013/2014
The game has been build from scratch, no frameworks were used. I have got the
idea to rebuild the game as a hobby project, but I'll be using Unity/C#.

Current features build in the game for as far as I can remember:

- Animated loading screen based on actual progress
- Basic animations for the world en entities
- Module monitors to display developers data
- Engine controls FPS and tickrate
- A* Pathfinder for player and monsters
- Non-walking area collision
- Ingame world editor supporting multiple map layers, spritesheets etc.
- Basic player versus environment combat
- Basic Graphical User Interface with experience bar
- Player data is saved as Serialized data
- The ability to die and respawn during combat
- Custom graphics / sprites / etc

Couple of screenshots have been included into the project
